Literature review/ Decision Analysis Impact Pathway statistics
Figures describing my literature research/ Decision Analysis Impact Pathway for my MSc. Thesis, showing distributions, limitations, and others. You can find maps, pie charts, and tables in the "Graphics"-Section.

I conducted my Literature research to draw a big Decision Analysis Impact Pathway, which I later reduced to model it with code. This research included 128 scientific sources (papers, books). Three Resources were only present in the literature review since these studies reflected generalized findings from European case studies, not including developing countries. Therefore they were not included in the model or the following plots.
Twenty more sources included R.package descriptions and websites, but these were also not included to conduct the figures or the model. I extracted 5 case study countries per study. > 5 case study countries were referred to as "Many" in the country table or "Different research areas" in the "Continent"- table. These case studies partly contained very many areas and were therefore referred to in this way. Therefore, I did not include these in the design of the maps.
I extracted two main topics per scientific resource.

# Top 15 country table
-> This table shows the 15 most often occurring countries. "General" refers to scientific sources researching a topic more "generalized" than by using case studies.

# Country pie chart
-> This pie chart represents the number of countries included in my model.

# Topics
-> I extracted one to two main topics per scientific resource. This distribution shows how often which main topics were present within the literature research.
