Figures describing my literature research/ Decision Analysis Impact Pathway for my MSc. Thesis, showing distributions, limitations, and others.

I conducted my Literature research to draw a detailed Decision Analysis Impact Pathway, which I later reduced to model it with code. This research included 155 scientific sources (papers, books). Among these, 48 papers were mehodological and therefore not included in the model itself, but in the literature review and the following plots. The visual model was created with 99 papers, one presentation and one policy brief. Some resources were only present in the literature review since these studies reflected generalized findings from European case studies, not including developing countries. Therefore they were not included in the model or the following plots.
Many more sources included R.package descriptions and websites, but these were also not included to conduct the figures or the model. Overall, there are 199 sources.

I extracted 5 case study countries per study. > 5 case study countries were referred to as "Many" in the country table or "Different research areas" in the "Continent"- table instead of listing all countries sperately. These case studies partly contained very many areas and were therefore referred to in this way (also in the excel sheet). For this reason, I also did not include these in the design of the maps.
I also extracted two main topics per scientific resource.

# Continent table
-> this table shows the  number of studies per continent.

# Continent pie chart
-> This pie chart represents the number of studies per continent, which were included in my model.

# Country table
-> This table shows the 15 most researched countries. "General" refers to scientific sources researching a topic more "generalized" than by using case studies.

# Topics
-> I extracted one to two main topics per scientific resource. I found 8 topic areas and studies containing "many" differnt topic to similar amounts. This distribution shows how often which main topics were present within the literature research. These areas can also be found in my detailed Decision Analysis Impact pathway.
